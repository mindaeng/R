# 
Y <- P184$BrainWeight
X <- P184$BodyWeight
plot(X,Y) # We cannot see linearity in this plot.

# To solve this problem, we can use Box-Cox Transformation
plot(X^0.5, Y^0.5) # When lambda of X,Y == 0.5
plot(log(X),log(Y)) # When lambda == 0
plot(X^-0.5,Y^-0.5) # When lambda == -0.5
plot(X^-1, Y^-1)  # When lambda == -1

# In these four plots, we have to compare which one shows linearity and no Heteroskedasticity.
# lambda == 0 and lambda == -0.5 look good but when lambda is -0.5, we can know that points are concentrated around zero.
# It means lambda == 0 is more appropriate.
